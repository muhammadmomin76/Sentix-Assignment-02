          Sentix is a cutting-edge sentiment analysis project that aims to
          develop a streamlined system for accurately analysing sentiment from
          various text sources. In today's digital age, understanding the
          sentiment expressed in text data is crucial for businesses and
          individuals to make informed decisions, gain insights into customer
          opinions, and effectively manage their brand reputation. The project
          focuses on training a sentiment analysis model using different
          sentiment datasets and creating a user-friendly interface that allows
          users to input their own text or import the latest tweets based on
          hashtags of interest. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and
          natural language processing techniques, Sentix enables the automated
          analysis of sentiment, saving significant time and effort compared to
          manual analysis.
